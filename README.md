# C++ ChatBot

A simple command-line chatbot built with C++ that can engage in basic conversations.

## Features

- **Pattern-based responses**: Recognizes keywords and responds appropriately
- **Random response selection**: Provides varied responses to keep conversations interesting
- **Case-insensitive input**: Works regardless of input capitalization
- **Multiple conversation topics**: Handles greetings, farewells, questions about itself, and more
- **Graceful exit**: Type 'quit' or 'exit' to end the conversation

## Supported Conversation Topics

- Greetings (hello, hi, hey, good morning, etc.)
- Farewells (bye, goodbye, see you, etc.)
- "How are you?"
- "What is your name?"
- "Help" - for usage information
- Weather-related questions
- Time-related questions
- Questions about favorites
- General conversation with fallback responses

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (g++ recommended)
- C++11 support or later
- Make (optional, for using Makefile)

## Building and Running

### Option 1: Using Makefile (Recommended)

```bash
# Build the chatbot
make

# Run the chatbot
make run

# Clean build files
make clean

# Show help
make help
```

### Option 2: Manual Compilation

```bash
# Compile the chatbot
g++ -std=c++11 -Wall -Wextra -O2 -o chatbot chatbot.cpp

# Run the chatbot
.\chatbot
```

## Usage

1. Start the chatbot by running the executable
2. Type your messages and press Enter
3. The chatbot will respond based on recognized patterns
4. Type 'quit' or 'exit' to end the conversation

## Example Conversation

```
=== C++ ChatBot ===
Hello! I'm your friendly chatbot. Type 'quit' or 'exit' to end our conversation.
===================

You: Hello!
ChatBot: Hi there! What's on your mind?

You: What's your name?
ChatBot: I'm ChatBot, your friendly AI assistant!

You: How are you?
ChatBot: I'm doing great, thank you for asking!

You: quit
ChatBot: Goodbye! Have a great day!
```

## Code Structure

The chatbot is implemented as a single C++ class with the following key components:

- **Response Management**: Uses maps and vectors to store and retrieve responses
- **Input Processing**: Converts input to lowercase and matches against keywords
- **Random Response Selection**: Uses random number generation for varied responses
- **Conversation Loop**: Maintains the chat session until user exits

## Customization

You can easily customize the chatbot by:

1. Adding new response patterns in the `initializeResponses()` method
2. Expanding the keyword lists for greetings and farewells
3. Adding new conversation topics by creating new entries in the `responses` map
4. Modifying the default responses for unrecognized input

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements include:

- Integration with external APIs (weather, news, etc.)
- Machine learning-based responses
- Persistent conversation history
- Web interface
- Voice input/output
- Multi-language support
